Please implement a Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm in Java.

class Edge: Defines edge structure.
class Subset: Defines subset element structure.
kruskals(int V, List<Edge> edges): Function to find the MST.
union(Subset[] subsets, int x, int y): Function to unite two disjoint sets.
findRoot(Subset[] subsets, int i): Function to find parent of a set.
Your program should also include a main function that tests your implementation with some sample inputs and outputs. Use appropriate comments and indentation to make your code readable and understandable.
